npm run test - To run the project

Test Endpoint: POST | http://localhost:3000/dev/user/risk


The main technical decisions i had to make was weather to split up each of the points deductions and additions based on the plan into separate modules or not. For the sake of this project i decided against it and only did so at a higher level which is for risk and insurance plan.
